## 🎯 Full Business Problem Statement & AI Discovery Reference

> "Project managers often set and track task deadlines without factoring in employee leave, so a deadline gets fixed without knowing whether the assigned person will actually be available for the full task duration. This gap means there's no built-in buffer or handover preparation when someone goes on leave mid-task — work simply stalls or gets rushed at the last minute because the leave was never factored into how the deadline was structured in the first place, rather than being planned around from the start.
Build a simple web app called "TaskFlow" for a single project manager to manage projects, tasks, and team leave — where the app prevents assigning a task to someone who's on leave during the task's scheduled dates.
Core Features (MVP only):
Team Members — Add/edit/delete a team member (name only, keep it minimal).
Leave Management — Add/edit/delete a leave record for a team member: select member, start date, end date. Show a simple list/calendar view of all upcoming and past leave records.
Projects — Add/edit/delete a project: name, start date, end date.
Tasks — Add/edit/delete a task under a project: title, assigned team member (dropdown), start date, due date, status (To Do / In Progress / Done).
Leave-Aware Assignment Block — When assigning or editing a task's assignee + dates, check if the selected team member has any leave record overlapping the task's start–due date range. If so, block the assignment with a clear inline error (e.g., "Priya is on leave from June 5–8, which overlaps this task's dates — choose another date range or team member.").
Project View — A view per project showing all its tasks grouped by status (To Do / In Progress / Done), like a simple kanban board.
Team Availability Overview — A simple dashboard showing each team member and their upcoming leave dates at a glance, so the PM can plan assignments before hitting the block."

### 🔍 In-Depth Problem Context & Operational Friction
- **Identified Core Bottleneck:** Project managers often set and track task deadlines without factoring in employee leave, so a deadline gets fixed without knowing whether the assigned person will actually be available for the full task duration. This gap means there's no built-in buffer or handover preparation when someone goes on leave mid-task — work simply stalls or gets rushed at the last minute because the leave was never factored into how the deadline was structured in the first place, rather than being planned around from the start.

## 🏆 Strategic Objectives & Expected Business Outcomes


- **Operational Automation:** Eliminate manual data entry, human error, and tracking delays across the operational lifecycle.
- **Real-Time Data Sovereignty:** Direct bidirectional synchronization with dedicated PostgreSQL cloud database.
- **SLA Acceleration:** Provide instant status visibility and priority queues to reduce turnaround cycle time.
- **Enterprise Scalability:** Modular fullstack React & TypeScript architecture ready for edge scale.

## 🛡️ Operational Constraints & Governance Guardrails

### Constraints & Compliance Guardrails:
- Local storage only — no backend, no auth, all data persists in-browser across sessions. Single-user (the PM) — team members and leave are just data records, not actual logins. Keep task status manual (PM/assignee marks it, no auto-progression logic needed). Core screens: Projects list → Project detail (kanban-style task board) → Team/Leave management view.
